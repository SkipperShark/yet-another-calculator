# calculator.md

## TODO 

- the calculator buttons dont scale so well with font size
- somehow, updating a state which is an array doesnt refresh the component
    <!-- - apparently i need to use the spread operator and a new element, but why though? -->
    <!-- - assigning an array to a variable just passes the reference to the array, when you change the variable, the original array also changes, because arrays in js are mutable -->
<!-- - the core functionality broke after we store the text data object into the arrUserSelection array, fix it -->
<!-- - multiplication functionality -->
<!-- -- division functionality -->
<!-- -- some weird issue where the button texts change for some reason ?!?? -->
-- core functionality (they cannot create an equation that has more than 2 operand)
    -- refer to this link for reference
        https://barhouum7.github.io/JS-Neumorphic-Calc.github.io/
<!-- -- Clear all functionality -->
<!-- -- negation functionality -->
<!-- -- floats funtionality -->
<!-- - dont allow the user to enter a "+" or "-" at the start of the arrow -->
<!-- - they should be allowed to enter the negator operand though -->
<!-- - don't allow 2 sequential math operators -->
<!-- -- if the user enters +, and then "-", the "-" should replace the "+" -->
<!-- -- replace all hardcoded strings with global variables  -->
<!-- -- styling for non numeric buttons -->
-- testing

# Enhancements
<!-- > reevaluate calculation when the negator is clicked -->
<!-- > recalculate past calculations -->
<!-- past calculations stylng -->
<!-- > use a table -->
> work on the division/multiplication prioritization algorithm
> refactor code alot and lots
> refactor the division/multiplication prioritisation algorithm
> TESTINg
    > google for expressions that we can test our calculator on
<!-- > if nothing is in the arr user selection and you click the equal, we get NaN -->
<!-- > Enhancement -->
<!-- > refer to this link for reference https://codepen.io/ssmkhrj/full/jOWBQqO -->
<!-- > allow the user to enter negation as the first characters -->
<!-- > ability for the user to enter more than 2 operands, and build a long equation -->
<!-- > math operator order functionality (multiplications and divions should be evaluated first) -->
<!-- > recalculate past calculations -->
<!-- > refactor the reducer function such that we can console.log the end cumulative result at the end of one iteration  -->
